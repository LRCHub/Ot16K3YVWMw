You can lie awake at night
Pretend not to see
But you can't put that apple
Back up on its tree
There ain't no worries
You can't drink away
I trust you to dig my grave

Woke up this morning
Poured a cup of the blues
I will always find a way to lose
Give me one reason
A reason I should stay
I trust you to dig my grave

Spend your whole life with one woman
Die and leave her your farm
The very next day she's on your best friend's arm
There ain't no worries
You can't drink away
I trust you to dig my grave

I walk but I stumble
I roll but I tumble
I reach but I fumble
I speak but I mumble
Comin' and goin'
A hundred different ways
I trust you to dig my grave

Don't want to be your first lover
I just want to be your last
If you promise not to tell
I promise not to ask
There ain't no worries
You can't drink away
Well, I trust you to dig my grave
I trust you
Oh I trust you
I trust you to dig my grave
