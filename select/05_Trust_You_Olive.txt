I don't know what I'm supposed to have said
But I can imagine what's in your head
It's not that you don't trust all that I do
It's just that you would have if it were you

Trust me, tell me
Truthfully, you can
Trust me, tell me
Faithfuly, you can
Trust me, trust you

I'm starting to question why I am here
Your constant suspicions don't make it clear
Just leave it, believe me I'll show the signs
You'll find her, the cheat that you have in mind

I have nothing to hide
And what could I deny

Trust me, tell me
Truthfully, you can
Trust me, tell me
Faithfuly, you can
Trust me, trust you

I have nothing to hide
And what could I deny

Trust me, tell me
Truthfully, you can
Trust me, tell me
Faithfuly, you can
Trust me, trust you

Trust me, tell me
Truthfully, you can
Trust me, tell me
Faithfuly, you can
Trust me, trust you
